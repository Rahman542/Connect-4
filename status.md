Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have only been able to construct the board

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

RIght now I have yet to come up with a way to get the red chip to go then the yellow chip to go right after that chip and make sure the red chip filled out that spot that you wanted it to go.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had basic problems constructed the blue "board" full of circles, but my main problem lies in figuring out an althogrythm so it can detect which player won. This stumps me a bit due to the nature that you can win in anyway as long as the 4 are the same color and are connecting.
