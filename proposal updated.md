# Proposal
Rahman Mohammed
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Connect 4 board game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A two person board game that lets you play the Connect 4 board game

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will allow multiplayer feats from the Connect 4. It will first show the insturcctions on how to play the game for new players. Players familair with the game will be able to opt out of the tutorial. The game will give the player the first player the choice of red or yellow. Red goes first. I will have to compile a code for each possible way of winning. One for setting up the board. One for creating the colored circle shaped chips. I will also have to make sure it accounts in order of red then yellow and thhe specified color matches in the 4 way winnable way and does not confuse the color scheme when winning. FOr the board I am going to use a clever trick and fill in the holes with a black or white color and then just replace them red and yellow when the piece is dropped. Because I do not relastically think I can animate the falling sensation of the piece dropping across every single empty circle for the whole board.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome is one that works but does not utilize the board or color chips.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A good outcome is one where I can utilize the board and chips of connect 4.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for me is to make the connect 4 board game but also with a scoreboard at the bottom of the screen to keep track and allow you to see where you will drop the chip in which section of the board. similar to chess or battle ship in the way that its structured like i.e. A-1, E-5.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

So right now, I need to lean how to make the board. I also need to learn how to have the pieces drop where they are supposed to go, and not randomly on the boards sturture. I really have to work on my combinations as well relating to this code. There are so many possible ways to win, soits spinning in my head how to win. But at the same time I have costantly played Connect 4 for a long time in my life so it will be fun to adapt my skills and try and play and work the kinks out in that manner. I also need to research about visuals, display, and etc. I am super worried about that. Using import turtle in this class to fabricate drawings was helpful but I now need to go further beyond and fabricate drawings and use them and put them in areas without placing them in a desired place beforehand. Because no player is going to know where they will put all there chips for the entire game before the game has started. So I have to not only brush up on that but really conduct my research on that specifically. I am worried about using the mouse to pick where to drop the chip, but I will have to also research that as well.
