Hi my final project is on Connect 4, it is a game I loved playing and I enjoyed making this code as I love this game
I enjoyed learning about numpy and the functions such as .zero, .where, and .diag to help construct an algothrym for accounting the pieces to connect 4
One of my stuggles was installing numpy through command prompt
I learned about installing such extensions
I also learned about data types as I used this when creating the board along with the .zeros fucntion for the inital state of the board
I learned about .diag as it helped me come up with ways to account for the diagnol wins in connect 4
I also got better at slicing as it was necessary to keep my code more condense but not have to rewrite code and just flip certain ways you can win
Overall, I'm happy. I was worried about my project video at first as I went 11 minutes explaining thwe code but was able to cut it down to 2. I was very frustrated at first with my code 
not being able to recognize the players switching but I used (move*=-1) at the very end to account for the change in players.
I was worried about the board but that was actually the easiest part.
The hardest part was definitely coming up with the possible ways of winning
I believe that this new knowledge did not only help in a coding aspect, but in an adaptability aspect. 
After the pig lab I was very frustrated and concerned when it came to constructing games in python but deciding to take the challenge on a game I love made it more fun overcoming
a more arduous task. I would say I also learned about adapting  to a situation and learning how to reserach topics about it to resolve a solution. I'm glad I was able to put my
mind to use and come up with the project and answer I wanted, but I'm also happy that I was able to do it while learning and beleiving that I could do it.
